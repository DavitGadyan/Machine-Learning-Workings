I would be honored.\\nARTHUR: What is your name?\\nBEDEVERE: Bedevere, my liege.\\nARTHUR: Then I dub you Sir Bedevere, Knight of the Round Table\\nNARRATOR: The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King Arthur's knights, but other illustrious names were soon to follow: Sir Lancelot the Brave; Sir Gallahad the Pure; and Sir Robin the-not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, who had nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol, and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill; and the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.  Together they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries: the Knights of the Round Table\\nSCENE 6: [clop clop clop] \\nSIR BEDEVERE: And that, my liege, is how we know the earth to be banana-shaped.\\nARTHUR: This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.\\nBEDEVERE: Oh, certainly, sir.\\nSIR LAUNCELOT: Look, my liege! [trumpets] \\nARTHUR: Camelot!\\nSIR GALAHAD: Camelot!\\nLAUNCELOT: Camelot!\\nPATSY: It's only a model.\\nARTHUR: Shh!  Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home.  Let us ride... to...  Camelot! [in medieval hall] \\nKNIGHTS: [singing] We're knights of the round table.  We dance when e'er we're able.  We do routines and chorus scenes With footwork impeccable.  We dine well here in Camelot.  We eat ham and jam and spam a lot [dancing] We're knights of the Round Table. Our shows are formidable, But many times we're given rhymes That are quite unsingable. We're opera mad in Camelot. We sing from the diaphragm a lot [in dungeon] \\nPRISONER: [clap clap clap clap] [in medieval hall] \\nKNIGHTS: [tap-dancing] In war we're tough and able, Quite indefatigable.  Between our quests we sequin vests and impersonate Clark Gable.  It's a busy life in Camelot.\\nMAN: I have to push the pram a lot [outdoors] \\nARTHUR: Well, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot.  It is a silly place.\\nKNIGHTS: Right.  Right\\nSCENE 7: [clop clop clop] [boom boom] [angels sing] \\nGOD: Arthur!  Arthur, King of the Britons!  Oh, don't grovel! [singing stops] One thing I can't stand, it's people groveling.\\nARTHUR: Sorry. [boom] \\nGOD: And don't apologise.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's 'sorry this' and 'forgive me that' and 'I'm not worthy'. [boom] What are you doing now?!\\nARTHUR: I'm averting my eyes, O Lord.\\nGOD: Well, don't.  It's like those miserable Psalms-- they're so depressing. Now knock it off!\\nARTHUR: Yes, Lord.\\nGOD: Right!  Arthur, King of the Britons, your Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times.\\nARTHUR: Good idea, O Lord!\\nGOD: 'Course it's a good idea!  Behold! [angels sing] Arthur, this is the Holy Grail.  Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task to seek this grail.  That is your purpose, Arthur...  the quest for the Holy Grail. [boom] [singing stops] \\nLAUNCELOT: A blessing!  A blessing from the Lord!\\nGALAHAD: God be praised\\nSCENE 8: [King Arthur music] [clop clop clop] \\nARTHUR: Halt! [horn] Hallo! [pause] Hallo!\\nFRENCH GUARD: Allo!  Who is eet?\\nARTHUR: It is King Arthur, and these are my Knights of the Round Table.  Who's castle is this?\\nFRENCH GUARD: This is the castle of my master Guy de Loimbard.\\nARTHUR: Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest.  If he will give us food and shelter for the night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.\\nFRENCH GUARD: Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen.  Uh, he's already got one, you see?\\nARTHUR: What?\\nGALAHAD: He says they've already got one!\\nARTHUR: Are you sure he's got one?\\nFRENCH GUARD: Oh, yes, it's very nice-a.  (I told him we already got one.)\\nARTHUR: Well, u-- um, can we come up and have a look?\\nFRENCH GUARD: Of course not!  You are English types-a!\\nARTHUR: Well, what are you then?\\nFRENCH GUARD: I'm French!  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king-a?!\\nGALAHAD: What are you doing in England?\\nFRENCH GUARD: Mind your own business!\\nARTHUR: If you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your castle by force!\\nFRENCH GUARD: You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!  Go and boil your bottom, sons of a silly person.  I blow my nose at you, so-called Arthur King, you and all your silly English k-nnnnniggets.  Thpppppt!  Thppt!

I fart in your general direction!  You mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!\\nGALAHAD: Is there someone else up there we could talk to?\\nFRENCH GUARD: No, now go away or I shall taunt you a second time-a! [sniff] \\nARTHUR: Now, this is your last chance.  I've been more than reasonable.\\nFRENCH GUARD: (Fetchez la vache.)\\nOTHER FRENCH GUARD: Quoi?\\nFRENCH GUARD: (Fetchez la vache!) [mooo] \\nARTHUR: If you do not agree to my commands, then I shall-- [twong] [mooooooo] Jesus Christ!\\nKNIGHTS: Christ! [thud] Ah!  Ohh!\\nARTHUR: Right!  Charge!\\nKNIGHTS: Charge!

Not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!\\nARTHUR: Who leaps out?\\nBEDEVERE: U-- u-- uh, Launcelot, Galahad, and I.  Uh, leap out of the rabbit, uh, and uh...\\nARTHUR: Ohh.\\nBEDEVERE: Oh.

The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise, and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion.  Arthur, having consulted his closest knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail individually. [clop clop clop] Now, this is what they did: Launcelot--\\nKNIGHT: Aaaah! [slash] [KNIGHT kills HISTORIAN] \\nHISTORIAN'S WIFE: Frank\\nSCENE 10: [trumpets] \\nNARRATOR: The Tale of Sir Robin.  So each of the knights went their separate ways.  Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of Ewing, accompanied by his favorite minstrels.\\nMINSTREL: [singing] Bravely bold Sir Robin, rode forth from Camelot.  He was not afraid to die, O brave Sir Robin.  He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways.  Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin!  He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp, Or to have his eyes gouged out, and his elbows broken.  To have his kneecaps split, and his body burned away, And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin!\\nHis head smashed in and his heart cut out, And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged, And his nostrils raped and his bottom burned off, And his pen--\\nSIR ROBIN: That's-- that's, uh-- that's enough music for now, lads.  Heh.  Looks like there's dirty work afoot.\\nDENNIS: Anarcho-syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom.\\nWOMAN: Oh, Dennis, forget about freedom.  We haven't got enough mud.\\nALL HEADS: Halt!  Who art thou?\\nMINSTREL: [singing] He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who--\\nROBIN: Shut up!  Um, n-- n-- n-- nobody really, I'm j-- j-- j-- ju-- just um, just passing through.\\nALL HEADS: What do you want?\\nMINSTREL: [singing] To fight and--\\nROBIN: Shut up!  Um, oo, a-- nothing, nothing really.  I, uh, j-- j-- just--just to um, just to p-- pass through, good Sir Knight.\\nALL HEADS: I'm afraid not!\\nROBIN: Ah.  W-- well, actually I-- I am a Knight of the Round Table.\\nALL HEADS: You're a Knight of the Round Table?\\nROBIN: I am.\\nLEFT HEAD: In that case I shall have to kill you.\\nMIDDLE HEAD: Shall I?\\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, I don't think so.\\nMIDDLE HEAD: Well, what do I think?\\nLEFT HEAD: I think kill him.\\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, let's be nice to him.\\nLEFT HEAD: Oh shut up.\\nROBIN: Perhaps I could--\\nLEFT HEAD: And you.  Oh, quick!  Get the sword out.  I want to cut his headoff!\\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, cut your own head off!\\nMIDDLE HEAD: Yes, do us all a favor!\\nLEFT HEAD: What?\\nRIGHT HEAD: Yapping on all the time.\\nMIDDLE HEAD: You're lucky.  You're not next to him.\\nLEFT HEAD: What do you mean?\\nMIDDLE HEAD: You snore!\\nLEFT HEAD: Oh, I don't.  Anyway, you've got bad breath.\\nMIDDLE HEAD: Well it's only because you don't brush my teeth.\\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh stop bitching and let's go have tea.\\nLEFT HEAD: Oh, all right.  All right.  All right.  We'll kill him first and then have tea and biscuits.\\nMIDDLE HEAD: Yes.\\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, not biscuits.\\nLEFT HEAD: All right.  All right, not biscuits, but let's kill him anyway.\\nALL HEADS: Right!\\nMIDDLE HEAD: He buggered off.\\nRIGHT HEAD: So he has.  He's scarper\\nMINSTREL: [singing] Brave Sir Robin ran away.\\nROBIN: No!\\nMINSTREL: [singing] Bravely ran away away.\\nROBIN: I didn't!\\nMINSTREL: [singing] When danger reared its ugly head, he bravely turned his tail and fled.\\nROBIN: No!\\nMINSTREL: [singing] Yes, brave Sir Robin turned about\\nROBIN: I didn't!\\nMINSTREL: [singing] And gallantly he chickened out, bravely taking to his feet.\\nROBIN: I never did!\\nMINSTREL: [singing] He beat a very brave retreat.\\nROBIN: All lies!\\nMINSTREL: [singing] Bravest of the brave, Sir Robin.\\nROBIN: I never\\nCARTOON MONKS: [chanting] Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem.\\nCARTOON CHARACTER: Heh heh heeh ooh...

Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.\\nGALAHAD: The Castle Anthrax?\\nZOOT: Yes.  Oh, it's not a very good name is it?  Oh, but we are nice and we will attend to your every, every need!\\nGALAHAD: You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?\\nZOOT: The what?\\nGALAHAD: The Grail.  It is here.\\nZOOT: Oh, but you are tired, and you must rest awhile.  Midget!  Crapper!\\nMIDGET and CRAPPER: Yes, O Zoot?\\nZOOT: Prepare a bed for our guest.\\nMIDGET and CRAPPER: Oh thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you! ...\\nZOOT: Away, away varletesses.  The beds here are warm and soft, and very, very big.\\nGALAHAD: Well, look, I-- I-- uh--\\nZOOT: What is your name, handsome knight?\\nGALAHAD: Sir Galahad...  the Chaste.\\nZOOT: Mine is Zoot.  Just Zoot.  Oh, but come.\\nGALAHAD: Look, please!  In God's name, show me the Grail!\\nZOOT: Oh, you have suffered much.  You are delirious.\\nGALAHAD: No, look.  I have seen it!  It is here, in this--\\nZOOT: Sir Galahad!  You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality.\\nGALAHAD: Well, I-- I-- uh--\\nZOOT: Oh, I am afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life: bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear.  We are just not used to handsome knights.  Nay.  Nay.  Come.  Come.  You may lie here.  Oh, but you are wounded!\\nGALAHAD: No, no-- it's-- it's nothing.\\nZOOT: Oh, you must see the doctors immediately!  No, no, please!  Lie down. [clap clap] \\nPIGLET: Well, what seems to be the trouble?\\nGALAHAD: They're doctors?!\\nZOOT: Uh, they have a basic medical training, yes.\\nGALAHAD: B-- but--\\nZOOT: Oh, come, come.  You must try to rest.  Doctor Piglet!  Doctor Winston!  Practice your art.\\nWINSTON: Try to relax.\\nGALAHAD: Are you sure that's absolutely necessary?\\nPIGLET: We must examine you.\\nGALAHAD: There's nothing wrong with that!\\nPIGLET: Please.  We are doctors.\\nGALAHAD: Look!  This cannot be.  I am sworn to chastity.\\nPIGLET: Back to your bed!  At once!\\nGALAHAD: Torment me no longer.  I have seen the Grail!\\nPIGLET: There's no grail here.\\nGALAHAD: I have seen it!  I have seen it! [clank] I have seen--\\nGIRLS: Hello.\\nGALAHAD: Oh.\\nGIRLS: Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.

I have seen it, here in this castle!\\nDINGO: Oh no.  Oh, no!  Bad, bad Zoot!\\nGALAHAD: Well, what is it?\\nDINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!  She has been setting alight to our beacon, which, I have just remembered, is grail-shaped.  It's not the first time we've had this problem.\\nGALAHAD: It's not the real Grail?\\nDINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot!  She is a bad person and must pay the penalty.  Do you think this scene should have been cut?  We were so worried when the boys were writing it, but now, we're glad.  It's better than some of the previous scenes, I think.\\nLEFT HEAD: At least ours was better visually.\\nDENNIS: Well, at least ours was committed.  It wasn't just a string of pussy jokes.\\nOLD MAN: Get on with it.\\nTIM THE ENCHANTER: Yes, get on with it!\\nARMY OF KNIGHTS: Yes, get on with it!\\nDINGO: Oh, I am enjoying this scene.\\nGOD: Get on with it!\\nDINGO: [sigh] Oh, wicked, wicked Zoot.  Oh, she is a naughty person, and she must pay the penalty.  And here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment for setting alight the grail-shaped beacon.  You must tie her down on a bed and spank her.\\nGIRLS: A spanking!  A spanking!\\nDINGO: You must spank her well.  And after you have spanked her, you may deal with her as you like.  And then, spank me.\\nAMAZING: And spank me.\\nSTUNNER: And me.\\nLOVELY: And me.\\nDINGO: Yes, yes, you must give us all a good spanking!\\nGIRLS: A spanking!  A spanking!  There is going to be a spanking tonight!\\nDINGO: And after the spanking, the oral sex.\\nGIRLS: The oral sex!  The oral sex!\\nGALAHAD: Well, I could stay a bit longer.\\nLAUNCELOT: Sir Galahad!\\nGALAHAD: Oh, hello.\\nLAUNCELOT: Quick!\\nGALAHAD: What?\\nLAUNCELOT: Quick!\\nGALAHAD: Why?\\nLAUNCELOT: You are in great peril!\\nDINGO: No he isn't.\\nLAUNCELOT: Silence, foul temptress!\\nGALAHAD: You know, she's got a point.\\nLAUNCELOT: Come on!  We will cover your escape!\\nGALAHAD: Look, I'm fine!\\nLAUNCELOT: Come on!\\nGIRLS: Sir Galahad!\\nGALAHAD: No.  Look, I can tackle this lot single-handed!\\nDINGO: Yes!  Let him tackle us single-handed!\\nGIRLS: Yes!  Let him tackle us single-handed!\\nLAUNCELOT: No, Sir Galahad.  Come on!\\nGALAHAD: No!  Really!  Honestly, I can cope.

[boom] \\nDINGO: Oh, shit.\\nLAUNCELOT: We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.\\nGALAHAD: I don't think I was.\\nLAUNCELOT: Yes you were.  You were in terrible peril.\\nGALAHAD: Look, let me go back in there and face the peril.\\nLAUNCELOT: No, it's too perilous.\\nGALAHAD: Look, it's my duty as a knight to sample as much peril as I can.\\nLAUNCELOT: No, we've got to find the Holy Grail.  Come on!\\nGALAHAD: Oh, let me have just a little bit of peril?\\nLAUNCELOT: No.  It's unhealthy.\\nGALAHAD: I bet you're gay.\\nLAUNCELOT: No I'm not\\nNARRATOR: Sir Launcelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation, but they were still no nearer the Grail.  Meanwhile, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere, not more than a swallow's flight away, had discovered something.  Oh, that's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously.  I mean, they were more than two laden swallows' flights away-- four, really, if they had a coconut on a line between them.  I mean, if the birds were walking and dragging--\\nCROWD: Get on with it!\\nNARRATOR: Oh, anyway.  On to scene twenty-four, which is a smashing scene with some lovely acting, in which Arthur discovers a vital clue, and in which there aren't any swallows, although I think you can hear a starling-- oooh\\nSCENE 12:\\nOLD MAN: Heh, hee ha ha hee hee!

Bloody weather\\nSCENE 14:\\nNARRATOR: The Tale of Sir Launcelot.\\nFATHER: One day, lad, all this will be yours!\\nPRINCE HERBERT: What, the curtains?\\nFATHER: No.  Not the curtains, lad.  All that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys of this land!  This'll be your kingdom, lad.\\nHERBERT: But Mother--\\nFATHER: Father, lad.  Father.\\nHERBERT: B-- b-- but Father, I don't want any of that.\\nFATHER: Listen, lad.  I built this kingdom up from nothing.  When I started here, all there was was swamp.  Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show 'em.  It sank into the swamp.  So, I built a second one.  That sank into the swamp.  So I built a third one.  That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp.  But the fourth one...  stayed up!  And that's what you're gonna get, lad: the strongest castle in these islands.\\nHERBERT: But I don't want any of that.  I'd rather--\\nFATHER: Rather what?!\\nHERBERT: I'd rather... [music] ... just...  sing!\\nFATHER: Stop that!  Stop that!  You're not going into a song while I'm here.  Now listen, lad.  In twenty minutes you're getting married to a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.\\nHERBERT: B-- but I don't want land.\\nFATHER: Listen, Alice,--\\nHERBERT: Herbert.\\nFATHER: 'Erbert.  We live in a bloody swamp.  We need all the land we can get.\\nHERBERT: But-- but I don't like her.\\nFATHER: Don't like her?!  What's wrong with her?!  She's beautiful.  She's rich.  She's got huge...  tracts o' land.\\nHERBERT: I know, but I want the-- the girl that I marry to have...  [music] ... a certain...  special...  something!\\nFATHER: Cut that out!  Cut that out!  Look, you're marrying Princess Lucky, so you'd better get used to the idea! [smack] Guards!  Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.\\nGUARD #1: Not to leave the room even if you come and get him.\\nGUARD #2: Hic!\\nFATHER: No, no.  Until I come and get him.\\nGUARD #1: Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room.\\nFATHER: No, no.  No.  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.\\nGUARD #1: And you'll come and get him.\\nGUARD #2: Hic!\\nFATHER: Right.\\nGUARD #1: We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.\\nFATHER: No, no.  Leaving the room.\\nGUARD #1: Leaving the room.  Yes.

No.  You just keep him in here, and make sure he--\\nGUARD #1: Oh, yes.  We'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him--\\nFATHER: No, no, no, no.  Just keep him in here--\\nGUARD #1: Until you, or anyone else--\\nFATHER: No, not anyone else.  Just me.\\nGUARD #1: Just you.\\nGUARD #2: Hic!\\nFATHER: Get back.\\nGUARD #1: Get back.\\nFATHER: All right?\\nGUARD #1: Right.  We'll stay here until you get back.\\nGUARD #2: Hic!\\nFATHER: And, uh, make sure he doesn't leave.\\nGUARD #1: What?\\nFATHER: Make sure 'e doesn't leave.\\nGUARD #1: The Prince?\\nFATHER: Yes.  Make sure 'e doesn't leave.\\nGUARD #1: Oh, yes, of course.  \\nGUARD #2: Hic!\\nGUARD #1: Ah.  I thought you meant him.  You know, it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard.\\nFATHER: Is that clear?\\nGUARD #2: Hic!\\nGUARD #1: Oh, quite clear.  No problems.\\nFATHER: Right.  Where are you going?\\nGUARD #1: We're coming with you.\\nFATHER: No, no.  I want you to stay here and make sure 'e doesn't leave.\\nGUARD #1: Oh, I see.

Hurry!\\nFATHER: Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father, that's all!\\nLAUNCELOT: Well, I really didn't mean to...\\nFATHER: Didn't mean to?!  You put your sword right through his head!\\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, dear.  Is he all right?\\nFATHER: You even kicked the bride in the chest!  This is going to cost me a fortune!\\nLAUNCELOT: Well, I can explain.  I was in the forest, um, riding north from Camelot, when I got this note, you see--\\nFATHER: Camelot?  Are you from, uh, Camelot?\\nHERBERT: Hurry, Sir Launcelot!\\nLAUNCELOT: Uh, I am a Knight of King Arthur, sir.\\nFATHER: Very nice castle, Camelot.

This is Sir Launcelot from the Court of Camelot, a very brave and influential knight, and my special guest here today.\\nLAUNCELOT: Hello.\\nGUEST: He killed my auntie!\\nGUESTS: [yelling] \\nFATHER: Please!  Please!  This is supposed to be a happy occasion!  Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who.  We are here today to witness the union of two young people in the joyful bond of the holy wedlock.  Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert, has just fallen to his death.\\nGUESTS: Oh!  Oh no!\\nFATHER: But I don't want to think I've not lost a son, so much as...  gained a daughter! [clap clap clap] For, since the tragic death of her father--\\nGUEST #2: He's not quite dead!\\nFATHER: Since the near fatal wounding of her father--\\nGUEST #2: He's getting better!\\nFATHER: For, since her own father, who, when he seemed about to recover, suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him.\\nBRIDE'S FATHER: Uugh!\\nGUEST #2: Oh, he's died!\\nFATHER: And I want his only daughter to look upon me as her old dad, in a very real, and legally binding sense. [clap clap clap] And I feel sure that the merger-- er, the union between the Princess and the brave, but dangerous, Sir Launcelot of Camelot--\\nLAUNCELOT: What?\\nGUEST #2: Look!  The dead Prince!\\nGUESTS: Oooh!  The dead Prince!\\nCONCORDE: He's not quite dead.\\nHERBERT: No, I feel much better.\\nFATHER: You fell out of the Tall Tower, you creep!\\nHERBERT: No, I was saved at the last minute.\\nFATHER: How?!\\nHERBERT: Well, I'll tell you.

There is a pestilence upon this land.  Nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under considerable economic stress at this period in history.\\nARTHUR: Did you say 'shrubberies'?\\nROGER: Yes.  Shrubberies are my trade.  I am a shrubber.  My name is Roger the Shrubber.  I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.\\nBEDEVERE: Ni!\\nARTHUR: No!  No, no, no!  No\\nSCENE 19:\\nARTHUR: O Knights of Ni, we have brought you your shrubbery.  May we go now?\\nHEAD KNIGHT: It is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly.  But there is one small problem.\\nARTHUR: What is that?\\nHEAD KNIGHT: We are now...  no longer the Knights Who Say 'Ni'.\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Ni!  Shh!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Shh!  We are now the Knights Who Say 'Ecky-ecky-ecky-ecky-pikang-zoop-boing-goodem-zoo-owli-zhiv'.\\nRANDOM: Ni!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Therefore, we must give you a test.\\nARTHUR: What is this test, O Knights of-- Knights Who 'Til Recently Said 'Ni'?\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Firstly, you must find...  another shrubbery! [dramatic chord] \\nARTHUR: Not another shrubbery!\\nRANDOM: Ni!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place it here beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you get the two-level effect with a little path running down the middle.\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: A path!  A path!  A path!  Ni!  Shh!  Ni!  Ni!  Ni!  Shh!  Shh! ...\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest...  with...  a herring!

Ohh!  Don't say that word.\\nARTHUR: What word?\\nHEAD KNIGHT: I cannot tell, suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni cannot hear.\\nARTHUR: How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what it is?\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: You said it again!\\nARTHUR: What, 'is'?\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Agh!  No, not 'is'.\\nHEAD KNIGHT: No, not 'is'.  You wouldn't get vary far in life not saying 'is'.\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: No, not 'is'.

Stop saying the word!  The word...\\nARTHUR: Oh, stop it!\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: ... we cannot hear!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Ow!  He said it again!\\nARTHUR: Patsy!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Wait!  I said it!  I said it!

Beyond the forest they met Launcelot and Galahad, and there was much rejoicing.\\nKNIGHTS: Yay!  Yay!

Oh...\\nTIM: To the north there lies a cave-- the cave of Caerbannog-- wherein, carved in mystic runes upon the very living rock, the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged... [boom] ... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.\\nARTHUR: Where could we find this cave, O Tim?\\nTIM: Follow.  But!  Follow only if ye be men of valor, for the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived!  Bones of full fifty men lie strewn about its lair.  So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or your strength, come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty, big, pointy teeth.\\nARTHUR: What an eccentric performance\\nSCENE 21: [clop clop clop] [whinny whinny] \\nGALAHAD: They're nervous, sire.\\nARTHUR: Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.

Then, shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.  Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three.  Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three.  Five is right out.  Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.'\\nMAYNARD: Amen.\\nKNIGHTS: Amen.\\nARTHUR: Right!

    "article='\\'\\'\\'Debugging\\'\\'\\' is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system.  \\n\\nNumerous books have been written about debugging (see below: #Further reading|Further reading), as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, Logfile|log files, monitoring (Application monitoring|application, System Monitoring|system), memory dumps, Profiling (computer programming)|profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes.\\n\\nOrigin\\nA computer log entry from the Mark&nbsp;II, with a moth taped to the page\\n\\nThe terms \"bug\" and \"debugging\" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s.[http://foldoc.org/Grace+Hopper Grace Hopper]  from FOLDOC While she was working on a Harvard Mark II|Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were \"debugging\" the system. However the term \"bug\" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison (see software bug for a full discussion), and \"debugging\" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers. Indeed, in an interview Grace Hopper remarked that she was not coining the term{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}. The moth fit the already existing terminology, so it was saved.  A letter from J. Robert Oppenheimer (director of the WWII atomic bomb \"Manhattan\" project at Los Alamos, NM) used the term in a letter to Dr. Ernest Lawrence at UC Berkeley, dated October 27, 1944,http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/Exhibits/physics/images/bigscience25.jpg regarding the recruitment of additional technical staff.\\n\\nThe Oxford English Dictionary entry for \"debug\" quotes the term \"debugging\" used in reference to airplane engine testing in a 1945 article in the Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society. An article in \"Airforce\" (June 1945 p.&nbsp;50) also refers to debugging, this time of aircraft cameras.  Hopper\\'s computer bug|bug was found on September 9, 1947. The term was not adopted by computer programmers until the early 1950s.\\nThe seminal article by GillS. Gill, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/98663 The Diagnosis of Mistakes in Programmes on the EDSAC], Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Vol. 206, No. 1087 (May 22, 1951), pp. 538-554 in 1951 is the earliest in-depth discussion of programming errors, but it does not use the term \"bug\" or \"debugging\".\\nIn the Association for Computing Machinery|ACM\\'s digital library, the term \"debugging\" is first used in three papers from 1952 ACM National Meetings.Robert V. D. Campbell, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=609784.609786 Evolution of automatic computation], Proceedings of the 1952 ACM national meeting (Pittsburgh), p 29-32, 1952.Alex Orden, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=609784.609793 Solution of systems of linear inequalities on a digital computer], Proceedings of the 1952 ACM national meeting (Pittsburgh), p. 91-95, 1952.Howard B.

Press, 1963\\n\\nKidwell\\'s article \\'\\'Stalking the Elusive Computer Bug\\'\\'Peggy Aldrich Kidwell, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728224&isnumber=15706 Stalking the Elusive Computer Bug], IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, 1998. discusses the etymology of \"bug\" and \"debug\" in greater detail.\\n\\nScope\\nAs software and electronic systems have become generally more complex, the various common debugging techniques have expanded with more methods to detect anomalies, assess impact, and schedule software patches or full updates to a system. The words \"anomaly\" and \"discrepancy\" can be used, as being more neutral terms, to avoid the words \"error\" and \"defect\" or \"bug\" where there might be an implication that all so-called \\'\\'errors\\'\\', \\'\\'defects\\'\\' or \\'\\'bugs\\'\\' must be fixed (at all costs). Instead, an impact assessment can be made to determine if changes to remove an \\'\\'anomaly\\'\\' (or \\'\\'discrepancy\\'\\') would be cost-effective for the system, or perhaps a scheduled new release might render the change(s) unnecessary. Not all issues are life-critical or mission-critical in a system. Also, it is important to avoid the situation where a change might be more upsetting to users, long-term, than living with the known problem(s) (where the \"cure would be worse than the disease\"). Basing decisions of the acceptability of some anomalies can avoid a culture of a \"zero-defects\" mandate, where people might be tempted to deny the existence of problems so that the result would appear as zero \\'\\'defects\\'\\'. Considering the collateral issues, such as the cost-versus-benefit impact assessment, then broader debugging techniques will expand to determine the frequency of anomalies (how often the same \"bugs\" occur) to help assess their impact to the overall system.\\n\\nTools\\nDebugging on video game consoles is usually done with special hardware such as this Xbox (console)|Xbox debug unit intended for developers.\\n\\nDebugging ranges in complexity from fixing simple errors to performing lengthy and tiresome tasks of data collection, analysis, and scheduling updates.  The debugging skill of the programmer can be a major factor in the ability to debug a problem, but the difficulty of software debugging varies greatly with the complexity of the system, and also depends, to some extent, on the programming language(s) used and the available tools, such as \\'\\'debuggers\\'\\'. Debuggers are software tools which enable the programmer to monitor the execution (computers)|execution of a program, stop it, restart it, set breakpoints, and change values in memory. The term \\'\\'debugger\\'\\' can also refer to the person who is doing the debugging.\\n\\nGenerally, high-level programming languages, such as Java (programming language)|Java, make debugging easier, because they have features such as exception handling that make real sources of erratic behaviour easier to spot. In programming languages such as C (programming language)|C or assembly language|assembly, bugs may cause silent problems such as memory corruption, and it is often difficult to see where the initial problem happened. In those cases, memory debugging|memory debugger tools may be needed.\\n\\nIn certain situations, general purpose software tools that are language specific in nature can be very useful.  These take the form of \\'\\'List of tools for static code analysis|static code analysis tools\\'\\'.  These tools look for a very specific set of known problems, some common and some rare, within the source code.  All such issues detected by these tools would rarely be picked up by a compiler or interpreter, thus they are not syntax checkers, but more semantic checkers.  Some tools claim to be able to detect 300+ unique problems. Both commercial and free tools exist in various languages.  These tools can be extremely useful when checking very large source trees, where it is impractical to do code walkthroughs.  A typical example of a problem detected would be a variable dereference that occurs \\'\\'before\\'\\' the variable is assigned a value.  Another example would be to perform strong type checking when the language does not require such.  Thus, they are better at locating likely errors, versus actual errors.  As a result, these tools have a reputation of false positives.  The old Unix \\'\\'Lint programming tool|lint\\'\\' program is an early example.\\n\\nFor debugging electronic hardware (e.g., computer hardware) as well as low-level software (e.g., BIOSes, device drivers) and firmware, instruments such as oscilloscopes, logic analyzers or in-circuit emulator|in-circuit emulators (ICEs) are often used, alone or in combination.  An ICE may perform many of the typical software debugger\\'s tasks on low-level software and firmware.\\n\\nDebugging process \\nNormally the first step in debugging is to attempt to reproduce the problem. This can be a non-trivial task, for example as with Parallel computing|parallel processes or some unusual software bugs. Also, specific user environment and usage history can make it difficult to reproduce the problem.\\n\\nAfter the bug is reproduced, the input of the program may need to be simplified to make it easier to debug. For example, a bug in a compiler can make it Crash (computing)|crash when parsing some large source file. However, after simplification of the test case, only few lines from the original source file can be sufficient to reproduce the same crash. Such simplification can be made manually, using a Divide and conquer algorithm|divide-and-conquer approach. The programmer will try to remove some parts of original test case and check if the problem still exists. When debugging the problem in a Graphical user interface|GUI, the programmer can try to skip some user interaction from the original problem description and check if remaining actions are sufficient for bugs to appear.\\n\\nAfter the test case is sufficiently simplified, a programmer can use a debugger tool to examine program states (values of variables, plus the call stack) and track down the origin of the problem(s). Alternatively, Tracing (software)|tracing can be used. In simple cases, tracing is just a few print statements, which output the values of variables at certain points of program execution.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\\n\\n Techniques \\n \\'\\'Interactive debugging\\'\\'\\n \\'\\'{{visible anchor|Print debugging}}\\'\\' (or tracing) is the act of watching (live or recorded) trace statements, or print statements, that indicate the flow of execution of a process. This is sometimes called \\'\\'{{visible anchor|printf debugging}}\\'\\', due to the use of the printf function in C. This kind of debugging was turned on by the command TRON in the original versions of the novice-oriented BASIC programming language. TRON stood for, \"Trace On.\" TRON caused the line numbers of each BASIC command line to print as the program ran.\\n \\'\\'Remote debugging\\'\\' is the process of debugging a program running on a system different from the debugger. To start remote debugging, a debugger connects to a remote system over a network. The debugger can then control the execution of the program on the remote system and retrieve information about its state.\\n \\'\\'Post-mortem debugging\\'\\' is debugging of the program after it has already Crash (computing)|crashed. Related techniques often include various tracing techniques (for example,[http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/185300443 Postmortem Debugging, Stephen Wormuller, Dr. Dobbs Journal, 2006]) and/or analysis of memory dump (or core dump) of the crashed process. The dump of the process could be obtained automatically by the system (for example, when process has terminated due to an unhandled exception), or by a programmer-inserted instruction, or manually by the interactive user.\\n \\'\\'\"Wolf fence\" algorithm:\\'\\' Edward Gauss described this simple but very useful and now famous algorithm in a 1982 article for communications of the ACM as follows: \"There\\'s one wolf in Alaska; how do you find it? First build a fence down the middle of the state, wait for the wolf to howl, determine which side of the fence it is on. Repeat process on that side only, until you get to the point where you can see the wolf.\"<ref name=\"communications of the ACM\">{{cite journal | title=\"Pracniques: The \"Wolf Fence\" Algorithm for Debugging\", | author=E.

Embedded systems are, by definition, not general-purpose designs: they are typically developed for a single task (or small range of tasks), and the platform is chosen specifically to optimize that application. Not only does this fact make life tough for embedded system developers, it also makes debugging and testing of these systems harder as well, since different debugging tools are needed in different platforms.\\n\\nto identify and fix bugs in the system (e.g. logical or synchronization problems in the code, or a design error in the hardware);\\nto collect information about the operating states of the system that may then be used to analyze the system: to find ways to boost its performance or to optimize other important characteristics (e.g. energy consumption, reliability, real-time response etc.).\\n\\nAnti-debugging\\nAnti-debugging is \"the implementation of one or more techniques within computer code that hinders attempts at reverse engineering or debugging a target process\".<ref name=\"veracode-antidebugging\">{{cite web |url=http://www.veracode.com/blog/2008/12/anti-debugging-series-part-i/ |title=Anti-Debugging Series - Part I |last=Shields |first=Tyler |date=2008-12-02 |work=Veracode |accessdate=2009-03-17}} It is actively used by recognized publishers in copy protection|copy-protection schemas, but is also used by malware to complicate its detection and elimination.<ref name=\"soft-prot\">[http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~mgagnon/software_protection_through_anti_debugging.pdf Software Protection through Anti-Debugging Michael N Gagnon, Stephen Taylor, Anup Ghosh] Techniques used in anti-debugging include:\\nAPI-based: check for the existence of a debugger using system information\\nException-based: check to see if exceptions are interfered with\\nProcess and thread blocks: check whether process and thread blocks have been manipulated\\nModified code: check for code modifications made by a debugger handling software breakpoints\\nHardware- and register-based: check for hardware breakpoints and CPU registers\\nTiming and latency: check the time taken for the execution of instructions\\nDetecting and penalizing debugger<ref name=\"soft-prot\" /><!-- reference does not exist -->\\n\\nAn early example of anti-debugging existed in early versions of Microsoft Word which, if a debugger was detected, produced a message that said: \"The tree of evil bears bitter fruit.

The details of how this is done depends on whether it is a hardware or software exception and how the software exception is implemented. Some exceptions, especially hardware ones, may be handled so gracefully that execution can resume where it was interrupted.\\n\\nAlternative approaches to exception handling in software are error checking, which maintains normal program flow with later explicit checks for contingencies reported using special return values or some auxiliary global variable such as C\\'s errno|{{C-lang|errno}} or floating point status flags; or input validation to premptively filter exceptional cases.\\n\\nSome programmers write software with \\'\\'\\'error reporting\\'\\'\\' features that collect details that may be helpful in fixing the problem, and display those details on the screen, or store them to a file such as a core dump, or in some cases an Motorola Q#Error reporting|automatic error reporting system such as Windows Error Reporting can automatically Phoning home|phone home and email those details to the programmers.\\n\\n Exception handling in hardware \\n\\nHardware exception mechanisms are processed by the CPU.

That operation might signal one or more exceptions by invoking the default or, if explicitly requested, a language-defined alternate handling.\"\\n\\nBy default, an IEEE 754 exception is resumable and is handled by substituting a predefined value for different exceptions, e.g. infinity for a divide by zero exception, and providing floating point#Dealing with exceptional cases|status flags for later checking of whether the exception occurred (see C99#IEEE&nbsp;754 floating point support|C99 programming language for a typical example of handling of IEEE 754 exceptions). An exception-handling style enabled by the use of status flags involves: first computing an expression using a fast, direct implementation; checking whether it failed by testing status flags; and then, if necessary, calling a slower, more numerically robust, implementation.<ref name=\"Xiaoye Li and James Demmel 1994 983вЂ“992\">{{cite journal |author1=Xiaoye Li |author2=James Demmel | title=Faster Numerical Algorithms via Exception Handling, IEEE Transactions on Computers, 43(8) | year= 1994 | pages=983вЂ“992}}\\n\\nThe IEEE 754 standard uses the term \"trapping\" to refer to the calling of a user-supplied exception-handling routine on exceptional conditions, and is an optional feature of the standard. The standard recommends several usage scenarios for this, including the implementation of non-default pre-substitution of a value followed by resumption, to concisely handle Removable singularity|removable singularities.<ref name=\"Xiaoye Li and James Demmel 1994 983вЂ“992\"/><ref name=grail>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Grail.pdf|title=A Demonstration of Presubstitution for в€ћ/в€ћ|author=W.Kahan|date=July 5, 2005}}{{cite journal|author=John Hauser|title=Handling Floating-Point Exceptions in Numeric Programs, ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems 18(2)| year= 1996|pages=139вЂ“174}}\\n\\nThe default IEEE 754 exception handling behaviour of resumption following pre-substitution of a default value avoids the risks inherent in changing flow of program control on numerical exceptions. For example, in 1996 the Ariane 5 Flight 501|maiden flight of the Ariane 5 (Flight 501) ended in a catastrophic explosion due in part to the Ada (programming language)|Ada programming language exception handling policy of aborting computation on arithmetic error, which in this case was a 64-bit floating point to 16-bit integer conversion Integer overflow|overflow.<ref name=grail /> In the Ariane Flight 501 case, the programmers protected only four out of seven critical variables against overflow due to concerns about the computational constraints of the on-board computer and relied on what turned out to be incorrect assumptions about the possible range of values for the three unprotected variables because they code reuse|reused code from the Ariane 4, for which their assumptions were correct.http://www.irisa.fr/pampa/EPEE/Ariane5.html According to William Kahan, the loss of Flight 501 would have been avoided if the IEEE 754 exception-handling policy of default substitution had been used because the overflowing 64-bit to 16-bit conversion that caused the software to abort occurred in a piece of code that turned out to be completely unnecessary on the Ariane 5.<ref name=grail /> The official report on the crash (conducted by an inquiry board headed by Jacques-Louis Lions) noted that \"An underlying theme in the development of Ariane 5 is the bias towards the Fault-tolerant computer system|mitigation of random failure. The supplier of the inertial navigation system (SRI) was only following the specification given to it, which stipulated that in the event of any detected exception the processor was to be stopped. The exception which occurred was not due to random failure but a design error. The exception was detected, but inappropriately handled because the view had been taken that software should be considered correct until it is shown to be at fault. [...] Although the failure was due to a systematic software design error, mechanisms can be introduced to mitigate this type of problem. For example the computers within the SRIs could have continued to provide their best estimates of the required Attitude control|attitude information. There is reason for concern that a software exception should be allowed, or even required, to cause a processor to halt while handling mission-critical equipment. Indeed, the loss of a proper software function is hazardous because the same software runs in both SRI units. In the case of Ariane 501, this resulted in the switch-off of two still healthy critical units of equipment.\"https://www.ima.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/ariane5rep.html\\n\\nFrom the processing point of view, hardware interrupts are similar to resumable exceptions, though they are typically unrelated to the user program\\'s control flow.\\n\\n Exception handling in software \\nSoftware exception handling and the support provided by software tools differs somewhat from what is understood under exception in hardware, but similar concepts are involved. In programming language mechanisms for exception handling, the term \\'\\'exception\\'\\' is typically used in a specific sense to denote a data structure storing information about an exceptional condition. One mechanism to transfer control, or \\'\\'raise\\'\\' an exception, is known as a \\'\\'throw\\'\\'. The exception is said to be \\'\\'thrown\\'\\'. Execution is transferred to a \"catch\".\\n\\nFrom the point of view of the author of a Subroutine|routine, raising an exception is a useful way to signal that a routine could not execute normally - for example, when an input argument is invalid (e.g. value is outside of the domain of a function) or when a resource it relies on is unavailable (like a missing file, a hard disk error, or out-of-memory errors). In systems without exceptions, routines would need to return some special error code. However, this is sometimes complicated by the semipredicate problem, in which users of the routine need to write extra code to distinguish normal return values from erroneous ones.\\n\\nProgramming languages differ substantially in their notion of what is an exception. Contemporary languages can roughly be divided in two groups:<ref name=\"Kiniry\">{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/11818502_16| chapter = Exceptions in Java and Eiffel: Two Extremes in Exception Design and Application| title = Advanced Topics in Exception Handling Techniques| volume = 4119| pages = 288| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| year = 2006| last1 = Kiniry | first1 = J.

The other major influence is examples of use, typically in core libraries and code examples in technical books, magazine articles, and online discussion forums, and in an organizationвЂ™s code standards.\"<ref name=\"Kiniry\"/>\\n\\nContemporary applications face many design challenges when considering exception handling strategies. Particularly in modern enterprise level applications, exceptions must often cross process boundaries and machine boundaries. Part of designing a solid exception handling strategy is recognizing when a process has failed to the point where it cannot be economically handled by the software portion of the process.All Exceptions Are Handled, Jim Wilcox, http://granitestatehacker.kataire.com/2008/02/all-exceptions-are-handled.html\\n\\nException handling is often not handled correctly in software, especially when there are multiple sources of exceptions; data flow analysis of 5 million lines of Java code found over 1300 exception handling defects.<ref name=\"toplas2008\">{{cite news|author1=Weimer, W  |author2=Necula, G.C.|title=Exceptional Situations and Program Reliability|journal=ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, vol 30 (2)|url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/p/weimer-toplas2008.pdf|year=2008}}\\n\\n= History =\\nSoftware exception handling developed in Lisp (programming language)|Lisp in the 1960s and 1970s. This originated in LISP 1.5 (1962), where exceptions were \\'\\'caught\\'\\' by the <code>ERRSET</code> keyword, which returned <code>NIL</code> in case of an error, instead of terminating the program or entering the debugger.{{sfn|Gabriel|Steele|2008|p=3}} Error \\'\\'raising\\'\\' was introduced in MacLisp in the late 1960s via the <code>ERR</code> keyword.{{sfn|Gabriel|Steele|2008|p=3}} This was rapidly used not only for error raising, but for non-local control flow, and thus was augmented by two new keywords, <code>CATCH</code> and <code>THROW</code> (MacLisp June 1972), reserving <code>ERRSET</code> and <code>ERR</code> for error handling. The cleanup behavior now generally called \"finally\" was introduced in NIL (programming language)|NIL (New Implementation of LISP) in the mid- to late-1970s as <code>UNWIND-PROTECT</code>.{{sfn|White|1979|p=194}} This was then adopted by Common Lisp. Contemporary with this was <code>dynamic-wind</code> in Scheme, which handled exceptions in closures. The first papers on structured exception handling were {{harvtxt|Goodenough|1975a}} and {{harvtxt|Goodenough|1975b}}.{{sfn|Stroustrup|1994|p=392}} Exception handling was subsequently widely adopted by many programming languages from the 1980s onward.\\n\\nOriginally, software exception handling included both resumable exceptions (resumption semantics), like most hardware exceptions, and non-resumable exceptions (termination semantics). However, resumption semantics were considered ineffective in practice in the 1970s and 1980s (see C++ standardization discussion, quoted below){{sfn|Stroustrup|1994|loc=16.6 Exception Handling: Resumption vs. Termination, pp. 390вЂ“393}} and are no longer in common use, though provided by programming languages like Common Lisp and Dylan.\\n\\n= Termination semantics =\\nException handling mechanisms in contemporary languages are typically non-resumable (\"termination semantics\") as opposed to hardware exceptions, which are typically resumable. This is based on experience of using both, as there are theoretical and design arguments in favor of either decision; these were extensively debated during C++ standardization discussions 1989вЂ“1991, which resulted in a definitive decision for termination semantics.{{sfn|Stroustrup|1994|loc=16.6 Exception Handling: Resumption vs. Termination, pp. 390вЂ“393}} On the rationale for such a design for the C++ mechanism, Bjarne Stroustrup|Stroustrup notes:\\n{{blockquote|[A]t the Palo Alto [C++ standardization] meeting in November 1991, we heard a brilliant summary of the arguments for termination semantics backed with both personal experience and data from James G. Mitchell|Jim Mitchell (from Sun, formerly from Xerox PARC). Jim had used exception handling in half a dozen languages over a period of 20 years and was an early proponent of resumption semantics as one of the main designers and implementers of Xerox\\'s Mesa/Cedar|Cedar/Mesa system. His message was\\n:вЂњtermination is preferred over resumption; this is not a matter of opinion but a matter of years of experience. Resumption is seductive, but not valid.вЂќ\\nHe backed this statement with experience from several operating systems. The key example was Cedar/Mesa: It was written by people who liked and used resumption, but after ten years of use, there was only one use of resumption left in the half million line system вЂ“ and that was a context inquiry. Because resumption wasn\\'t actually necessary for such a context inquiry, they removed it and found a significant speed increase in that part of the system. In each and every case where resumption had been used it had вЂ“ over the ten years вЂ“ become a problem and a more appropriate design had replaced it. Basically, every use of resumption had represented a failure to keep separate levels of abstraction disjoint.{{sfn|Stroustrup|1994|p=392}}}}\\n\\n= Criticism =\\nA contrasting view on the safety of exception handling was given by Tony Hoare|C.A.R Hoare in 1980, describing the Ada (programming language)|Ada programming language as having \"...a plethora of features and notational conventions, many of them unnecessary and some of them, like exception handling, even dangerous.

This problem ended up being solved by RAII, but while RAII solves it, the fact that it is needed is still a source of criticism.\\n\\n= Exception support in programming languages =<!-- This section is linked from Throwing -->\\n{{See also|Exception handling syntax}}\\nMany computer languages have built-in support for exceptions and exception handling. This includes ActionScript, Ada programming language|Ada, BlitzMax, C++, C Sharp (programming language)|C#, COBOL, D programming language|D, ECMAScript, Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel, Java (programming language)|Java, ML programming language|ML, Object Pascal (e.g. Delphi programming language|Delphi, Free Pascal, and the like), PowerBuilder, Objective-C, OCaml, PHP (as of version 5), PL/1, PL/SQL, Prolog, Python (programming language)|Python, REALbasic, Ruby (programming language)|Ruby, Scala (programming language)|Scala, Seed7, Tcl, Visual Prolog and most .NET Framework|.NET languages. Exception handling is commonly not resumable in those languages, and when an exception is thrown, the program searches back through the call stack|stack of function calls until an exception handler is found.\\n\\nSome languages call for stack unwinding|unwinding the stack as this search progresses. That is, if function {{mono|f}}, containing a handler  {{mono|H}} for exception {{mono|E}}, calls function {{mono|g}}, which in turn calls function {{mono|h}}, and an exception {{mono|E}} occurs in {{mono|h}}, then functions {{mono|h}} and {{mono|g}} may be terminated, and {{mono|H}} in {{mono|f}} will handle {{mono|E}}.\\n\\nAn exception-handling language without this unwinding is Common Lisp with its Exception handling#Condition systems|Condition System. Common Lisp calls the exception handler and does not unwind the stack. This allows the program to continue the computation at exactly the same place where the error occurred (for example when a previously missing file has become available). The stackless implementation of the \\'\\'Mythryl\\'\\' programming language supports constant-time exception handling without stack unwinding.\\n\\nExcluding minor syntactic differences, there are only a couple of exception handling styles in use. In the most popular style, an exception is initiated by a special statement (<code>throw</code> or <code>raise</code>) with an exception object (e.g. with Java or Object Pascal) or a value of a special extendable enumerated type (e.g. with Ada). The scope for exception handlers starts with a marker clause (<code>try</code> or the language\\'s block starter such as <code>begin</code>) and ends in the start of the first handler clause (<code>catch</code>, <code>except</code>, <code>rescue</code>). Several handler clauses can follow, and each can specify which exception types it handles and what name it uses for the exception object.\\n\\nA few languages also permit a clause (<code>else</code>) that is used in case no exception occurred before the end of the handler\\'s scope was reached.\\n\\nMore common is a related clause (<code>finally</code> or <code>ensure</code>) that is executed whether an exception occurred or not, typically to release resources acquired within the body of the exception-handling block. Notably, C++ does not provide this construct, since it encourages the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) technique which frees resources using destructor (computer programming)|destructors.\\n\\nIn its whole, exception handling code might look like this (in Java (programming language)|Java-like pseudocode; note that an exception type called <code>EmptyLineException</code> would need to be declared somewhere):\\n\\n<source lang=CSharp>\\ntry {\\n    line = console.readLine();\\n\\n    if (line.length()  0) {\\n        throw new EmptyLineException(\"The line read from console was empty!\");\\n    }\\n\\n    console.printLine(\"Hello %s!\" % line);\\n    console.printLine(\"The program ran successfully\");\\n}\\ncatch (EmptyLineException e) {\\n    console.printLine(\"Hello!\");\\n}\\ncatch (Exception e) {\\n    console.printLine(\"Error: \" + e.message());\\n}\\nfinally {\\n    console.printLine(\"The program terminates now\");\\n}\\n</source>\\n\\nAs a minor variation, some languages use a single handler clause, which deals with the class of the exception internally.\\n\\nAccording to a 2008 paper by Westley Wiemer and George Necula, the syntax of the <code>try</code>...<code>finally</code> blocks in Java is a contributing factor to software defects. When a method needs to handle the acquisition and release of 3вЂ“5 resources, programmers are apparently unwilling to nest enough blocks due to readability concerns, even when this would be a correct solution. It is possible to use a single <code>try</code>...<code>finally</code> block even when dealing with multiple resources, but that requires a correct use of sentinel values, which is another common source of bugs for this type of problem.<ref name=\"toplas2008\"/>{{rp|8:6вЂ“8:7}} Regarding the semantics of the <code>try</code>...<code>catch</code>...<code>finally</code> construct in general, Wiemer and Necula write that \"While try-catch-finally is conceptually simple, it has the most complicated execution description in the language specification [Gosling et al. 1996] and requires four levels of nested вЂњifвЂќs in its official English description. In short, it contains a large number of corner cases that programmers often overlook.\"<ref name=\"toplas2008\"/>{{rp|8:13вЂ“8:14}}\\n\\nC supports various means of error checking, but generally is not considered to support \"exception handling,\" although Setjmp.h|the <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code> standard library functions can be used to implement exception semantics.\\n\\nPerl has optional support for structured exception handling.\\n\\nPython (programming language)|Python\\'s support for exception handling is pervasive and consistent. It\\'s difficult to write a robust Python program without using its {{Python|try}} and {{Python|except}} keywords.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\\n\\n= Exception handling implementation =\\n\\nThe implementation of exception handling in programming languages typically involves a fair amount of support from both a code generator and the runtime system accompanying a compiler. (It was the addition of exception handling to C++ that ended the useful lifetime of the original C++ compiler, Cfront.Scott Meyers, [http://www.artima.com/cppsource/top_cpp_software.html The Most Important C++ Software...Ever], 2006)  Two schemes are most common. The first, \\'\\'dynamic registration\\'\\', generates code that continually updates structures about the program state in terms of exception handling.D. Cameron, P. Faust, D. Lenkov, M. Mehta, \"A portable implementation of C++ exception handling\", \\'\\'Proceedings of the C++ Conference\\'\\' (August 1992) USENIX.  Typically, this adds a new element to the Call stack|stack frame layout that knows what handlers are available for the function or method associated with that frame; if an exception is thrown, a pointer in the layout directs the runtime to the appropriate handler code. This approach is compact in terms of space, but adds execution overhead on frame entry and exit. It was commonly used in many Ada implementations, for example, where complex generation and runtime support was already needed for many other language features. Dynamic registration, being fairly straightforward to define, is amenable to proof of correctness.Graham Hutton, Joel Wright, \"[http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/exceptions.pdf Compiling Exceptions Correctly]\". \\'\\'Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction\\'\\', 2004.\\n\\nThe second scheme, and the one implemented in many production-quality C++ compilers, is a \\'\\'table-driven\\'\\' approach. This creates static tables at compile time and link time that relate ranges of the program counter to the program state with respect to exception handling.{{cite journal | title=Exception handling вЂ“ Supporting the runtime mechanism | last=Lajoie | first= JosГ©e | journal=C++ Report | volume=6 | issue=3 | date=MarchвЂ“April 1994}}  Then, if an exception is thrown, the runtime system looks up the current instruction location in the tables and determines what handlers are in play and what needs to be done. This approach minimizes executive overhead for the case where an exception is not thrown. This happens at the cost of some space, but this space can be allocated into read-only, special-purpose data sections that are not loaded or relocated until an exception is actually thrown.<ref name=cppeh>{{cite journal | title=Optimizing away C++ exception handling | last=Schilling | first=Jonathan L. | journal=SIGPLAN Notices | volume=33 | issue=8 | date=August 1998 | pages=40вЂ“47 | doi=10.1145/286385.286390}}  This second approach is also superior in terms of achieving thread safety{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}.\\n\\nOther definitional and implementation schemes have been proposed as well.\"[http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/how-to-implement-software-exception-handling/]\", Intel Corporation.

The idea is to provide a more rigorous basis for exception handling by defining precisely what is \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" behavior. Specifically, the approach is based on two concepts:\\n\\n \\'\\'\\'Failure\\'\\'\\': the inability of an operation to fulfill its contract. For example, an addition may produce an arithmetic overflow (it does not fulfill its contract of computing a good approximation to the mathematical sum); or a routine may fail to meet its postcondition.\\n \\'\\'\\'Exception\\'\\'\\': an abnormal event occurring during the execution of a routine (that routine is the \"\\'\\'recipient\\'\\'\" of the exception) during its execution. Such an abnormal event results from the \\'\\'failure\\'\\' of an operation called by the routine.\\n\\nThe \"Safe Exception Handling principle\" as introduced by Bertrand Meyer in Object-Oriented Software Construction then holds that there are only two meaningful ways a routine can react when an exception occurs:\\n\\n Failure, or \"organized panic\": The routine fixes the object\\'s state by re-establishing the invariant (this is the \"organized\" part), and then fails (panics), triggering an exception in its caller (so that the abnormal event is not ignored).\\n Retry: The routine tries the algorithm again, usually after changing some values so that the next attempt will have a better chance to succeed.\\n\\nIn particular, simply ignoring an exception is not permitted; a block must either be retried and successfully complete, or propagate the exception to its caller.\\n\\nHere is an example expressed in Eiffel syntax. It assumes that a routine {{Eiffel|send_fast}} is normally the better way to send a message, but it may fail, triggering an exception; if so, the algorithm next uses {{Eiffel|send_slow}}, which will fail less often. If {{Eiffel|send_slow}} fails, the routine {{Eiffel|send}} as a whole should fail, causing the caller to get an exception.\\n\\n<source lang=Eiffel>\\nsend (m: MESSAGE) is\\n  -- Send m through fast link, if possible, otherwise through slow link.\\nlocal\\n  tried_fast, tried_slow: BOOLEAN\\ndo\\n  if tried_fast then\\n     tried_slow := True\\n     send_slow (m)\\n  else\\n     tried_fast := True\\n     send_fast (m)\\n  end\\nrescue\\n  if not tried_slow then\\n     retry\\n  end\\nend\\n</source>\\n\\nThe boolean local variables are initialized to False at the start. If  {{Eiffel|send_fast}} fails, the body ({{Eiffel|do}} clause) will be executed again, causing execution of {{Eiffel|send_slow}}. If this execution of {{Eiffel|send_slow}} fails, the {{Eiffel|rescue}} clause will execute to the end with no {{Eiffel|retry}} (no {{Eiffel|else}} clause in the final {{Eiffel|if}}), causing the routine execution as a whole to fail.\\n\\nThis approach has the merit of defining clearly what \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" cases are: an abnormal case, causing an exception, is one in which the routine is unable to fulfill its contract. It defines a clear distribution of roles: the {{Eiffel|do}} clause (normal body) is in charge of achieving, or attempting to achieve, the routine\\'s contract; the {{Eiffel|rescue}} clause is in charge of reestablishing the context and restarting the process, if this has a chance of succeeding, but not of performing any actual computation.\\n\\nAlthough exceptions in Eiffel have a fairly clear philosophy, Kiniry (2006) criticizes their implementation because \"Exceptions that are part of the language definition are represented by INTEGER values, developer-defined exceptions by STRING values. [...] Additionally, because they are basic values and not objects, they have no inherent semantics beyond that which is expressed in a helper routine which necessarily cannot be foolproof because of the representation overloading in effect (e.g., one cannot\\ndifferentiate two integers of the same value).\"<ref name=\"Kiniry\"/>\\n\\n= Uncaught exceptions =\\nIf an exception is thrown and not caught (operationally, an exception is thrown when there is no applicable handler specified), the uncaught exception is handled by the runtime; the routine that does this is called the \\'\\'\\'{{visible anchor|uncaught exception handler}}\\'\\'\\'.<ref name=\"cocoa\">\\'\\'Mac Developer Library\\'\\', \"[https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Exceptions/Concepts/UncaughtExceptions.html Uncaught Exceptions]\"\\'\\'MSDN\\'\\', [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.appdomain.unhandledexception(v=vs.110).aspx AppDomain.UnhandledException Event] The most common default behavior is to terminate the program and print an error message to the console, usually including debug information such as a string representation of the exception and the stack trace.<ref name=\"cocoa\"/>\\'\\'The Python Tutorial\\'\\', \"[https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/errors.html 8.

This is particularly important for servers, where for example a servlet (running in its own thread) can be terminated without the server overall being affected.\\n\\nThis default uncaught exception handler may be overridden, either globally or per-thread, for example to provide alternative logging or end-user reporting of uncaught exceptions, or to restart threads that terminate due to an uncaught exception. For example, in Java this is done for a single thread via <code>[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#setUncaughtExceptionHandler-java.lang.Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler- Thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler]</code> and globally via <code>[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler- Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler]</code>; in Python this is done by modifying <code>[https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.excepthook sys.excepthook]</code>.\\n\\n= Static checking of exceptions =\\n\\n Checked exceptions \\n\\nThe designers of Java devised[http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9901&L=rmi-users&F=P&P=36083 Re: Toward a more \"automatic\" RMI = compatible with basic RMI philosophy], Ann Wollrath (JavaSoft East).

A function could raise only exceptions listed in its type, but any leaking exceptions from called functions would automatically be turned into the sole runtime exception, {{code|failure}}, instead of resulting in compile-time error. Later, Modula-3 had a similar feature.{{cite web|url=http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/graphics/modula3/tutorial/www/m3_23.html#SEC23 |title=Modula-3 - Procedure Types |publisher=.cs.columbia.edu |date=1995-03-08 |accessdate=2011-12-15}} These features don\\'t include the compile time checking that is central in the concept of checked exceptions, and hasn\\'t (as of 2006) been incorporated into major programming languages other than Java.{{cite web|url=http://www.mindview.net/Etc/Discussions/CheckedExceptions |title=Bruce Eckel\\'s MindView, Inc: Does Java need Checked Exceptions? |publisher=Mindview.net |accessdate=2011-12-15}}\\n\\nThe C++ programming language introduces an optional mechanism for checked exceptions, called \\'\\'exception specifications\\'\\'. By default any function can throw any exception, but this can be limited by a {{Cpp|throw}} clause added to the function signature, that specifies which exceptions the function may throw. Exception specifications are not enforced at compile-time. Violations result in the global function {{Cpp|std::unexpected}} being called.<ref name=bjarne-exc>Bjarne Stroustrup, \\'\\'The C++ Programming Language\\'\\' Third Edition, Addison Wesley, 1997. ISBN 0-201-88954-4. pp. 375-380.  An empty exception specification may be given, which indicates that the function will throw no exception. This was not made the default when exception handling was added to the language because it would require too much modification of existing code, would impede interaction with code written in another language, and would tempt programmers into writing too many handlers at the local level.<ref name=bjarne-exc/> Explicit use of empty exception specifications can, however, allow C++ compilers to perform significant code and stack layout optimizations that generally have to be suppressed when exception handling may take place in a function.<ref name=cppeh />  Some analysts view the proper use of exception specifications in C++ as difficult to achieve.{{cite journal | title=Ten Guidelines for Exception Specifications | last=Reeves | first= J.W. | journal=C++ Report | volume=8 | issue=7 |date=July 1996}} In the {{as of|2012|alt=recent|url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/}} C++ language standard (C++11), the use of exception specifications as specified in the preceding version of the standard (C++03) is Deprecation|deprecated.{{cite web|url=http://herbsutter.com/2010/03/13/trip-report-march-2010-iso-c-standards-meeting/ |title=Trip Report: March 2010 ISO C++ Standards Meeting |last=Sutter |first=Herb |authorlink=Herb Sutter |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=24 March 2010}}\\n\\nIn contrast to Java, languages like C# do not enforce that exceptions have to be caught. According to Hanspeter MГ¶ssenbГ¶ck, not distinguishing between to-be-called (checked) exceptions and not-to-be-called (unchecked) exceptions makes the written program more convenient, but less robust, as an uncaught exception results in an abort with a stack trace.{{cite web\\n| accessdate = 2011-08-05\\n| date       = 2002-03-25\\n| first      = Hanspeter\\n| last       = MГ¶ssenbГ¶ck\\n| location   = http://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/Lectures/CSharp/Tutorial/\\n| page       = 32\\n| publisher  = Institut fГјr Systemsoftware, Johannes Kepler UniversitГ¤t Linz, Fachbereich Informatik\\n| title      = Advanced C#: Variable Number of Parameters\\n| url        = http://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/Lectures/CSharp/Tutorial/Part2.pdf}}\\n Kiniry (2006) notes however that Java\\'s JDK (version 1.4.1) throws a large number of unchecked exceptions: one for every 140 lines of code, whereas Eiffel uses them much more sparingly, with one thrown every 4,600 lines of code. Kiniry also writes that \"As any Java programmer knows, the volume of <code>try catch</code> code in a typical Java application is sometimes larger than the comparable code necessary for explicit formal parameter and return value checking in other languages that do not have checked exceptions. In fact, the general consensus among in-the-trenches Java programmers is that dealing with checked exceptions is nearly as unpleasant a task as writing documentation. Thus, many programmers report that they вЂњresentвЂќ checked exceptions. This leads to an abundance of checked-but-ignored exceptions\".<ref name=\"Kiniry\"/> Kiniry also notes that the developers of C# apparently were influenced by this kind of user experiences, with the following quote being attributed to them (via Eric Gunnerson): {{quote|\"Examination of small programs leads to the conclusion that requiring exception specifications could both enhance developer productivity and enhance code quality, but experience with large software projects suggests a different result вЂ“ decreased productivity and little or no increase in code quality.\"<ref name=\"Kiniry\"/>}} According to Anders Hejlsberg there was fairly broad agreement in their design group to not have checked exceptions as a language feature in C#. Hejlsberg explained in an interview that {{quote|вЂњThe throws clause, at least the way it\\'s implemented in Java, doesn\\'t necessarily force you to handle the exceptions, but if you don\\'t handle them, it forces you to acknowledge precisely which exceptions might pass through. It requires you to either catch declared exceptions or put them in your own throws clause. To work around this requirement, people do ridiculous things. For example, they decorate every method with, \"throws Exception.\" That just completely defeats the feature, and you just made the programmer write more gobbledy gunk.

Unchecked exceptions (such as the Java (programming language)|Java objects {{Java|RuntimeException}} and {{Java|Error}}) remain unhandled.\\n\\nHowever, checked exceptions can either require extensive {{Java|throws}} declarations, revealing implementation details and reducing encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulation, or encourage coding poorly considered {{Java|try/catch}} blocks that can hide legitimate exceptions from their appropriate handlers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Consider a growing codebase over time. An interface may be declared to throw exceptions X and Y. In a later version of the code, if one wants to throw exception Z, it would make the new code incompatible with the earlier uses. Furthermore, with the adapter pattern, in which one body of code declares an interface that is then implemented by a different body of code so that code can be plugged in and called by the first, the adapter code may have a rich set of exceptions to describe problems, but is forced to use the exception types declared in the interface.\\n\\nIt is possible to reduce the number of declared exceptions either by declaring a superclass (computer science)|superclass of all potentially thrown exceptions, or by defining and declaring exception types that are suitable for the level of abstraction of the called methodBloch 2001:178 {{cite book | last = Bloch | first = Joshua | year = 2001 | title = Effective Java Programming Language Guide | publisher = Addison-Wesley Professional | isbn = 0-201-31005-8 }} and mapping lower level exceptions to these types, preferably wrapped using exception chaining in order to preserve the root cause. In addition, it\\'s very possible that in the example above of the changing interface that the calling code would need to be modified as well, since in some sense the exceptions a method may throw are part of the method\\'s implicit interface anyway.\\n\\nUsing a {{C++|throws Exception}} declaration or {{C++|catch (Exception e)}} is usually sufficient for satisfying the checking in Java. While this may have some use, it essentially circumvents the checked exception mechanism, which Oracle discourages.{{cite web|url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/advantages.html |title=Advantages of Exceptions (The Javaв„ў Tutorials : Essential Classes : Exceptions) |publisher=Download.oracle.com |accessdate=2011-12-15}}\\n\\nUnchecked exception types should generally not be handled, except possibly at the outermost levels of scope.

In order to establish that exception handling routines are sufficiently robust, it is necessary to present the code with a wide spectrum of invalid or unexpected inputs, such as can be created via software fault injection and mutation testing (that is also sometimes referred to as fuzz testing). One of the most difficult types of software for which to write exception handling routines is protocol software, since a robust protocol implementation must be prepared to receive input that does not comply with the relevant specification(s).\\n\\nIn order to ensure that meaningful regression analysis can be conducted throughout a Software development process|software development lifecycle process, any exception handling testing should be highly automated, and the test cases must be generated in a scientific, repeatable fashion. Several commercially available systems exist that perform such testing.\\n\\nIn runtime engine environments such as Java (programming language)|Java or .NET Framework|.NET, there exist tools that attach to the runtime engine and every time that an exception of interest occurs, they record debugging information that existed in memory at the time the exception was thrown (call stack and heap (data structure)|heap values). These tools are called automated exception handling or error interception tools and provide \\'root-cause\\' information for exceptions.\\n\\n= Exception synchronicity =\\n\\nSomewhat related with the concept of checked exceptions is \\'\\'exception synchronicity\\'\\'. Synchronous exceptions happen at a specific program statement whereas \\'\\'\\'asynchronous exceptions\\'\\'\\' can raise practically anywhere.{{cite web|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/415348.html |title=Asynchronous Exceptions in Haskell - Marlow, Jones, Moran (ResearchIndex) |publisher=Citeseer.ist.psu.edu |accessdate=2011-12-15}}Safe asynchronous exceptions for Python. http://www.cs.williams.edu/~freund/papers/02-lwl2.ps It follows that asynchronous exception handling can\\'t be required by the compiler.

Examples of naturally asynchronous events include pressing Control-C|Ctrl-C to interrupt a program, and receiving a Signal (computing)|signal such as \"stop\" or \"suspend\" from another Thread (computer science)|thread of execution.\\n\\nProgramming languages typically deal with this by limiting asynchronicity, for example Java has deprecated the use of its ThreadDeath exception that was used to allow one thread to stop another one.{{cite web|url=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/misc/threadPrimitiveDeprecation.html |title=Java Thread Primitive Deprecation |publisher=Java.sun.com |accessdate=2011-12-15}} Instead, there can be semi-asynchronous exceptions that only raise in suitable locations of the program or synchronously.\\n\\n= Condition systems =\\nCommon Lisp, Dylan programming language|Dylan and Smalltalk have a condition system{{cite web|author = What Conditions (Exceptions) are Really About|url = http://danweinreb.org/blog/what-conditions-exceptions-are-really-about|title = What Conditions (Exceptions) are Really About|publisher = Danweinreb.org|date = 2008-03-24|accessdate = 2014-09-18|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130201124021/http://danweinreb.org/blog/what-conditions-exceptions-are-really-about|archivedate = February 1, 2013}} (see Common Lisp#Condition system|Common Lisp Condition System) that encompasses the aforementioned exception handling systems. In those languages or environments the advent of a condition (a \"generalisation of an error\" according to Kent Pitman) implies a function call, and only late in the exception handler the decision to unwind the stack may be taken.\\n\\nConditions are a generalization of exceptions. When a condition arises, an appropriate condition handler is searched for  and selected, in stack order, to handle the condition. Conditions that do not represent errors may safely go unhandled entirely; their only purpose may be to propagate hints or warnings toward the user.{{cite web|url=http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/6.2/ansicl/section/conditio.htm |title=Condition System Concepts |publisher=Franz.com |date=2009-07-21 |accessdate=2011-12-15}}\\n\\n Continuable exceptions \\nThis is related to the so-called \\'\\'resumption model\\'\\' of exception handling, in which some exceptions are said to be \\'\\'continuable\\'\\': it is permitted to return to the expression that signaled an exception, after having taken corrective action in the handler. The condition system is generalized thus: within the handler of a non-serious condition (a.k.a. \\'\\'continuable exception\\'\\'), it is possible to jump to predefined restart points (a.k.a. \\'\\'restarts\\'\\') that lie between the signaling expression and the condition handler. Restarts are functions closed over some lexical environment, allowing the programmer to repair this environment before exiting the condition handler completely or unwinding the stack even partially.\\n\\n Restarts separate mechanism from policy \\nCondition handling moreover provides a separation of mechanism from policy. Restarts provide various possible mechanisms for recovering from error, but do not select which mechanism is appropriate in a given situation. That is the province of the condition handler, which (since it is located in higher-level code) has access to a broader view.\\n\\nAn example: Suppose there is a library function whose purpose is to parse a single syslog file entry. What should this function do if the entry is malformed? There is no one right answer, because the same library could be deployed in programs for many different purposes. In an interactive log-file browser, the right thing to do might be to return the entry unparsed, so the user can see itвЂ”but in an automated log-summarizing program, the right thing to do might be to supply null values for the unreadable fields, but abort with an error, if too many entries have been malformed.\\n\\nThat is to say, the question can only be answered in terms of the broader goals of the program, which are not known to the general-purpose library function. Nonetheless, exiting with an error message is only rarely the right answer. So instead of simply exiting with an error, the function may \\'\\'establish restarts\\'\\' offering various ways to continueвЂ”for instance, to skip the log entry, to supply default or null values for the unreadable fields, to ask the user for the missing values, \\'\\'or\\'\\' to unwind the stack and abort processing with an error message. The restarts offered constitute the \\'\\'mechanisms\\'\\' available for recovering from error; the selection of restart by the condition handler supplies the \\'\\'policy\\'\\'.\\n\\nSee also\\n Exception handling syntax\\n Automated exception handling\\n Exception safety\\n Continuation\\n Defensive programming\\n setjmp/longjmp\\n Triple fault\\n Vectored Exception Handling (VEH)\\n Option types and Result types, alternative ways of handling errors in functional programming without exceptions\\n\\nReferences\\n{{reflist|2}}\\n{{refbegin}}\\n {{Cite conference| doi = 10.1145/1529966.1529967| title = A Pattern of Language Evolution| conference = LISP50: Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of Lisp| pages = 1вЂ“10| year = 2008| last1 = Gabriel | first1 = Richard P.| authorlink1 = Richard P.

    "article='\\ufeffThe taxi-hailing company Uber brings into very sharp focus the question of whether corporations can be said to have a moral character. If any human being were to behave with the single-minded and ruthless greed of the company, we would consider them sociopathic. Uber wanted to know as much as possible about the people who use its service, and those who don’t. It has an arrangement with unroll.me, a company which offered a free service for unsubscribing from junk mail, to buy the contacts unroll.me customers had had with rival taxi companies. Even if their email was notionally anonymised, this use of it was not something the users had bargained for. Beyond that, it keeps track of the phones that have been used to summon its services even after the original owner has sold them, attempting this with Apple’s phones even thought it is forbidden by the company.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUber has also tweaked its software so that regulatory agencies that the company regarded as hostile would, when they tried to hire a driver, be given false reports about the location of its cars. Uber management booked and then cancelled rides with a rival taxi-hailing company which took their vehicles out of circulation. Uber deny this was the intention. The punishment for this behaviour was negligible. Uber promised not to use this “greyball” software against law enforcement – one wonders what would happen to someone carrying a knife who promised never to stab a policeman with it. Travis Kalanick of Uber got a personal dressing down from Tim Cook, who runs Apple, but the company did not prohibit the use of the app. Too much money was at stake for that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMillions of people around the world value the cheapness and convenience of Uber’s rides too much to care about the lack of drivers’ rights or pay. Many of the users themselves are not much richer than the drivers. The “sharing economy” encourages the insecure and exploited to exploit others equally insecure to the profit of a tiny clique of billionaires. Silicon Valley’s culture seems hostile to humane and democratic values. The outgoing CEO of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, who is widely judged to have been a failure, is likely to get a $186m payout. This may not be a cause for panic, any more than the previous hero worship should have been a cause for euphoria. Yet there’s an urgent political task to tame these companies, to ensure they are punished when they break the law, that they pay their taxes fairly and that they behave responsibly.'"

    "article=\"\\ufeffédition abonné\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDans une tribune au « Monde », l’universitaire Charles Cuvelliez estime que le fantasme d’un remplacement de l’homme par l’algorithme et le robot repose sur un malentendu.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLe Monde | 10.05.2017 à 06h44 • Mis à jour le 10.05.2017 à 09h47 | Par Charles Cuvelliez (Professeur à l’Ecole polytechnique de l'université libre de Bruxelles)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTRIBUNE. L’usage morbide, par certains, de Facebook Live a amené son fondateur à annoncer précipitamment le recrutement de 3 000 modérateurs supplémentaires. Il est vrai que l’intelligence artificielle (IA) est bien en peine de reconnaître des contenus violents, surtout diffusés en direct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLe quotidien affreux de ces modérateurs, contraints de visionner des horreurs à longueur de journée, mériterait pourtant qu’on les remplace vite par des machines !\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nL’IA ne peut pas tout, mais là où elle peut beaucoup, on la maudit, accusée de détruire nos emplois, de remplacer la convivialité humaine. Ce débat repose sur un malentendu.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIl vient d’une définition de l’IA qui n’a, dans la réalité, jamais pu être mise en pratique : en 1955, elle était vue comme la création de programmes informatiques qui, quoi qu’on leur confie, le feraient un jour mieux que les humains. On pensait que toute caractéristique de l’intelligence humaine pourrait un jour être si précisément décrite qu’il suffirait d’une machine pour la simuler. Ce n’est pas vrai.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAngoisses infondées\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nComme le dit un récent Livre blanc sur la question (Pourquoi il ne faut pas avoir peur de l’Intelligence arti\\xadficielle, Julien Maldonato, Deloitte, mars 2017), rien ne pourra remplacer un humain dans sa globalité.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nL’IA, c’est de l’apprentissage automatique doté d’un processus d’ajustement de modèles statistiques à des masses de données, explique l’auteur. Il s’agit d’un apprentissage sur des paramètres pour lesquels une vision humaine n’explique pas pourquoi ils marchent si bien dans un contexte donné.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nC’est aussi ce que dit le rapport de l’Office parlementaire d’évaluation des choix scientifiques et technologiques (« Pour une intelligence artificielle maîtrisée, utile et démystifiée », 29 mars 2017), pour qui ce côté « boîte noire » explique des angoisses infondées. Ethiquement, se fonder sur l’IA pour des tâches critiques sans bien comprendre le comment...\""
